    <p>I am an aspiring web developer! I love to learn new things and apply them to create new and unique projects and assist others in creating their dreams. This page is the result of my self-taught determination to learn coding! I hope you like what you see and you might even want to work with me.</p>

    <p>I am a 32-year-old developer. Born in Baltimore, MD., I've always had a drive to learn new things. Even as a child, I was taught basic computing skills alongside my mother and have never lost the interest in seeking new knowledge. I'm always looking for ways to test my abilities and use my knowledge and skill to create new things and help others to do so.</p>
